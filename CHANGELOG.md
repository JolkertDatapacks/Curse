# Version 1.0.0 (2022-12-25)
* Added basic curse functionality
* Works almost exactly like the Hermitcraft "Tag" datapack from [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* When the ender dragon is killed for the first time, the player who dealt the final blow will be cursed
* If the cursed player hits another player with the curse item, the curse will be passed to the other player
* The curse has a cooldown of 90 seconds
* Currently untested. Bugfixes likely once I start testing
